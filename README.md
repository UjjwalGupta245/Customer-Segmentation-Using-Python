# Customer Segmentation on Mall 

Project Overview
This project explores customer segmentation using clustering techniques in Python. It’s my first hands-on experience with clustering, specifically the K-Means algorithm, and it was an exciting learning journey! The goal was to group mall customers into distinct segments based on their purchasing behaviour, helping businesses better understand and target their audience.

Key Steps and Methods:

1. Data Preparation
Checked the dataset for null values to ensure clean and accurate analysis.
Utilized Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and preparation.
2. K-Means Clustering
Imported the K-Means algorithm from the sklearn.cluster library.
Learned the concept of clustering and applied it to segment customers effectively.
3. Determining the Number of Clusters
Used the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters:
Calculated the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) for different cluster counts.
Plotted WCSS values and identified the "elbow point," where the decrease in WCSS slows.
The elbow point indicates the ideal number of clusters for the dataset.
4. Visualization
Created a scatter plot to visualize the clusters and understand their characteristics.
Leveraged Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for effective data visualization.

Skills and Tools Learned:

Data Cleaning: Ensuring the dataset is accurate and free of null values.

K-Means Clustering: Learning and applying clustering techniques using the K-Means algorithm.

Elbow Method: Understanding and using the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

Data Visualization: Creating scatter plots to visualize clusters and understand their characteristics.

Python Libraries: Using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn for data analytics and visualization.

Libraries Used:

Pandas and NumPy for data cleaning and manipulation.

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

Sklearn for implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm.


Conclusion:

This project was a valuable introduction to clustering techniques and customer segmentation. It deepened my understanding of the Elbow Method and showed me how visualization can simplify complex data patterns. I’m excited to apply this learning to larger datasets in future projects.
